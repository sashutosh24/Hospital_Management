Subash Gupta is a world-renowned pioneer in liver transplantation from
India. He has created and developed this non-existent specialty in
India. Previously patients had to travel aboard to get this treatment
at a very high cost (over 300 000 US dollars). His innovative
techniques have brought down the cost to a fraction of what it costs
elsewhere and made liver transplant available to patients from the
Indian subcontinent..<br><br>A national talent scholar, he graduated
from ALL India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. After
finishing his training abroad, he joined Sir Ganga Ram Hospital in 1998
where he started the liver transplant program. Facing many difficulties
in the new procedure of right lobe adult-to-adult living donor
transplantation, he introduced surgical innovations such as appropriate
drainage of anterior segment using the middle vein clamp test. This
original work was acknowledged in Annual meeting of International Liver
Transplant Society in New York in 2009. He is also credited with liver
transplants for unusual and difficult conditions such as portal
biliopathy, coexisting HIV infection and situs inversus.<br><br>Following
his successful establishment of the program in Sir Ganga Ram Hospital,
he joined the liver transplant program in Indraprastha Apollo
Hospitals, New Delhi where he has now done over 1500 transplants. He
has been instrumental in helping other liver transplant programmes in
the country.<br><br>Currently at his Centre, there are trainees from
Iraq, Kurdistan, Kenya and Pakistan and from different parts of India.
In the past trainees have come from Italy, Bangladesh and Myanmar. He
has written several chapters in books such as the Textbook of API
medicine. He has published over 30 papers on liver transplantation and
gastrointestinal surgery in both national and international journals<br>He
has been honored with the position of Associate Professor in Surgery in
University of Queensland, Australia. He has been honored by the
Institute of Post graduate Education and medical research, Kolkata as a
full Professor of Liver Transplantation. He has delivered the annual
oration In JIPMER, Puducherry Scientific Society in 2011 and is a
recipient of a Gold Medal by the Delhi Medical Association in 2005.<br><br><strong>He has introduced a number of innovations such as:</strong><br>-Introduction of surgery without the use of expensive immunoglobulins for hepatitis B transplants (Hepatitis B Protocol)<br>-Introduction of HTK solution<br>-Introduction of Middle Hepatic Vein grafts-Middle hepatic vein and right hepatic artery clamp test for graft type selection<br>-Extended right lobe graft for better patient outcome.<br>-Elimination of the cumbersome venovenous by pass technique of recipient hepatectomy.<br>-Decreasing the incidence of bile leak in recipient surgery.<br>He has an excellent track record for donor safety.</p><br><span class="subtitle" style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 136, 182); text-transform: capitalize;"><a name="3" id="3">Dr Ashutosh Chauhan</a></span><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td height="10" valign="top"><br>

is the largest abdominal organ. Liver weighs about 1200 &#8211; 1500 grams in
an average roughly 2% of body weight. Liver, though a single organ,
broadly it can be divided into two parts &#8211; right and left liver and 8
independent segments (each having its own blood supply and biliary
drainage) functioning as a single organ. Liver as a whole has a hepatic
artery supplying oxygenated blood, a portal vein carrying blood from
intestines to liver and bile ducts draining bile formed in the liver to
intestines. Blood from liver is delivered to heart via three hepatic
veins.<br><br>Liver produces bile which is drained by biliary tree.
Gall bladder is a reservoir for the bile lies on the liver bed, and is
attached to bile duct. It regulates delivery of bile into intestines.
Liver is endowed with remarkable capacity to regenerate after division
into parts. This is the basis of Live Related Liver Transplants, and
the reason why live related liver transplant is possible.<br><br><strong>Functions of Liver</strong><br>The
liver is in the right upper abdomen. The liver serves many functions,
including the detoxification of substances delivered to it from the
intestines, and the synthesis of many proteins.<br></p><ul style="padding-left: 20px;"><li>Liver

failure causes many problems, including malnutrition, problems with
blood clotting, bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract, and jaundice.
Frequently, patients who undergo liver transplantation are quite ill,
and require hospitalization in the Intensive Care Unit prior to
surgery. A large, upper abdominal specialized incision is used for
liver transplant.<br><br>Liver transplants are performed in many
centers across the country. The healthy liver is obtained either from a
living donor or from a donor who has recently died but has not suffered
liver injury. The diseased liver is removed through an incision made in
the upper abdomen. The new liver is put in place and attached to the
patient's blood vessels and bile ducts. The operation can take up to 12
hours to complete and may require large volumes of blood transfusions.<br><br>Patients
require hospital care for one to four weeks after liver transplant,
depending on the degree of illness. After liver transplantation,
patients must take immunosuppressive medications for the rest of their
lives to prevent immune rejection of the transplanted organ.<br><br><strong>What is liver transplant?<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></strong><br>Liver
transplant means removing a whole or part of liver from a deceased or
living person, placing and attaching in a patient of end stage liver
disease, after removing whole liver.</p><p style="margin-top: 0px; font-size: 8pt; color: rgb(109, 109, 109); font-family: Arial,Verdana,Helvetica,sans-serif; line-height: 19.2px;"><strong>What are types of liver transplant?</strong><br>Liver is obtained from a Deceased donor or Live Related donor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br><strong>Deceased Donor (Cadaver) &#8211;<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></strong>Liver
is obtained from patients who are brain dead. (They are actually dead
for from legal, ethical, spiritual and clinical point of view). Once a
brain dead patient is identified, and is deemed as a potential donor,
the blood supply to his body is maintained artificially. This is the
principle of deceased organ donation. Young patients who die of
accidents, brain hemorrhage or other causes of sudden death are the
donors suitable for organ donation.<br><strong>Living Donor &#8211;</strong><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>Part
of liver from living related donor is a certain and timely available
option and only hope for cure. Liver surgery can be carried out safely
in almost all patients. All patients are listed for deceased donor
liver but timely organ availability is uncertain. Liver has the
capacity to regenerate if a part of normal healthy liver is removed.
Hence we can divide part of liver from a live donor and implant it into
another patient. In a live donor liver transplant, a portion of the
liver is surgically removed from a live donor and transplanted into a
recipient immediately after the recipient&#8217;s liver has been entirely
removed.<br>Donor safety is the first objective of whole process.
Utmost care is taken while selecting and operating liver donors. The
risk of serious morbidities following a living donor liver resection is
10%.The risk of death in the donor is 0.02to 0.05%. Live donor liver
transplantation is possible because the liver (unlike any other organ
in the body) has the ability to grow back to its original size. The
regeneration of liver following surgery is complete by 4 to 8 weeks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0px; font-size: 8pt; color: rgb(109, 109, 109); font-family: Arial,Verdana,Helvetica,sans-serif; line-height: 19.2px;"><strong>Who can donate?</strong><br>Selecting
the correct donor for a live donor liver transplant requires

talk to transplant team members to understand what to expect, although
the surgery and recovery process can differ among living donors.
Consider talking with other donors and contacting the organizations. As
a liver donor, you may stay in the hospital up to 10 days or longer in
some cases. The liver typically regenerates in two months. Most liver
donor returns to works and normal activities in three months, although
some may need more time. Attend follow-up visits to clinic regularly as
advised and do blood or other investigations to make sure that you are
recovering approximately. Think about how the donation process may
affect your daily activities. How much time off will you need for work?
How will this affect your care giving responsibilities such as
childcare or caring for an elderly relative? How it is going to affect
your personal life and body image?<br><strong>What are the risks of liver transplant?</strong><br>The
biggest risks associated with liver transplants are rejection and
infection..Rejection occurs when the body&#8217;s immune system attacks the
new liver as an unwanted foreign substance; just as it would attack a
virus. To prevent rejection, transplant patients must take drugs to
suppress the immune system. However, because the immune system is
weakened, it is harder for liver transplant patients to fight other
kinds of infections. Fortunately, most infections can be treated with
other medicines.</p><p style="margin-top: 0px; font-size: 8pt; color: rgb(109, 109, 109); font-family: Arial,Verdana,Helvetica,sans-serif; line-height: 19.2px;"><strong>What medicines do I have to take?<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></strong><br>-Anti rejection drugs<br>-For the first three months after transplantation you need to take the following medicines.<br>-Antibiotics &#8211; to reduce the risk of&nbsp; infections<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>-Antifungal liquid &#8211; to reduce the risk of fungal infection<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>-Antacid &#8211; to reduce the risk of stomach ulcers and heartburn<br>-Any other medicines that you have to take will be prescribed for you depending on your&nbsp;<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>Symptoms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0px; font-size: 8pt; color: rgb(109, 109, 109); font-family: Arial,Verdana,Helvetica,sans-serif; line-height: 19.2px;"><strong>Why are Anti Rejection Drugs (Immunosuppressant Drugs) needed?</strong><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>One&#8217;s
body doesn&#8217;t accept other&#8217;s organ. It is body&#8217;s defense system to try
to attack and destroy other&#8217;s organ. Anti rejection drugs makes defense
mechanism weak against donor&#8217;s organ and allow liver graft to sustain
and work normally.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br><strong>What precautions should I take after my liver transplant?</strong><br>Communication,
cooperation and coordination between the&nbsp; transplant team, local
physician, pharmacist, Liver Transplant Coordinator or Liver Transplant
Consultant and the patient is essential for well-being of the Liver
Transplanted recipient. It is important to follow the instructions that
will help prevent or lessen complications.<br>One of a patient's most
important jobs is to ensure that family physician, local pharmacist,
and his family members are aware of the transplant, the medications he
takes each day, and the precautions he must follow to stay healthy.
Each of his family members should have the telephone number of his
Liver Transplant Coordinator or Liver Transplant Consultant.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>The
